CONS
 - Slow. Slower then all agents I tested. Claude code is faster than this. Opencode still the fastest.
 - I had to build it, there is not a pre-built image for linux. 
 - Browser tab sometimes closes out of the blue.
 - When I try to push, I had to type my github credentials inside the docker container on the terminal but I could not type.
 - I had to paste the username for github. I was able to "login with github" it sucks they dont have the integration on the UI for credentials.
 - When I paste the user I got this:
 ```
 https://sketch.dev/s/fb6d-7qgd-2wtn-518s ($1.25/10.00)> Username for 'https://github.com': diegopacheco
ü¶∏ diegopacheco
üï¥Ô∏è  I see you've mentioned "diegopacheco" - could you clarify what you'd like me to do with this? Are you:

- Looking to add this as a team member in the coaching application?
- Need me to reference this GitHub username for something?
- Want me to configure git settings?
- Something else entirely?

Let me know how I can help!
```
 - I had to create a token and paste on the web terminal (ugh so bad)
