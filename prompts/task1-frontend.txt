Task 1: Create the frontend.

I want a frontend app with(all using latest versions):

bun
typescript
React
I want to build a coaching application, where we should have the following pages:

Add Team member(name, picture, email)
Create Team(team name, team logo)
Assign to Team (add person to team)
Give feedback (to any team or person)
Do not call the backend, make React components, and reuse as much as possible.

Do not use comments; make the code as simple as possible.

the frontend code must be in a frontend/ folder
