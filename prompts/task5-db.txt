Task 5: Create the database. You must have a top-level folder called db/, where you will have schema.sql, which contains the SQL commands to create the database and schema, along with the tables.
Ensure you are using Docker and Docker Compose. I want a single Docker Compose file that sets up the backend, frontend, and MySQL 9, all running. Ensure that the schema is created when the MySQL Docker container boots or is ready.
Each source code folder should have they own docker. /fontend/Dockerfile /backend/Dockerfile
mysql should have a data folder mapped to a local dir db/mysql_data/ which also should be added to .gitignore. this when when the containers goes up and down we dont loose data.
provide start.sh script to boot the full stack update README instructions
also make sure to only do the PR when it's working 100%
