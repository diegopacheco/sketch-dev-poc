Task 2: Create the Backend.

I want a backend app written in Go(all using the latest versions):

gin gonic
MySQL Database
I want to build a coaching application, where we should have the following pages:

Add Team member(name, picture, email)
Create Team(team name, team logo)
Assign to Team (add person to team)
Give feedback (to any team or person)
Expose REST endpoints and reuse as much as possible.

Do not use comments; make the code as simple as possible.

make a folder called backend, add all go code there. also make sure you have a script called build.sh to build the backend and run.sh to run the backend app.

bckend code`must be in the folder /backend.
