echo "ðŸ”§ BACKEND CONTAINER HEALTH FIX VALIDATION"
echo "============================================="

echo -e "\nâœ… ISSUE IDENTIFIED:"
echo "   - Backend container was failing health checks"
echo "   - Health check used 'wget' which wasn't installed in alpine container"
echo "   - No retry logic for database connections during startup"

echo -e "\nâœ… FIXES APPLIED:"

echo -e "\nðŸ“¦ 1. Backend Dockerfile Updates:"
echo "   - Added curl and wget to runtime dependencies:"
grep -A 1 "apk --no-cache add" /app/backend/Dockerfile
echo "   - Updated health check to use curl:"
grep -A 1 "HEALTHCHECK" /app/backend/Dockerfile

echo -e "\nðŸ“¦ 2. Docker Compose Health Check Improvements:"
echo "   - Backend health check:"
grep -A 4 "backend:" /app/docker-compose.yml | grep -A 3 "healthcheck:"
echo "   - Frontend health check:"
grep -A 4 "frontend:" /app/docker-compose.yml | grep -A 3 "healthcheck:"

echo -e "\nðŸ“¦ 3. Database Connection Resilience:"
echo "   - Added retry logic with exponential backoff:"
grep -A 10 "maxRetries := 30" /app/backend/database/database.go

echo -e "\nðŸ“¦ 4. Frontend Dockerfile Updates:"
echo "   - Added curl for health checks:"
grep "apk --no-cache add curl" /app/frontend/Dockerfile

echo -e "\nâœ… SUMMARY OF CHANGES:"
echo "   1. âœ… Added curl/wget to Alpine containers"
echo "   2. âœ… Improved health check commands"
echo "   3. âœ… Increased health check timeouts and start periods"
echo "   4. âœ… Added database connection retry logic with backoff"
echo "   5. âœ… Enhanced error logging for troubleshooting"

echo -e "\nðŸŽ¯ EXPECTED RESULTS:"
echo "   - Backend container will wait for MySQL and retry connections"
echo "   - Health checks will use curl (available in containers)"
echo "   - Longer timeouts prevent premature health check failures"
echo "   - Better error messages for debugging"

echo -e "\nðŸš€ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT!"
echo "   Run './start.sh' to test the complete stack"
